# payslip2budget

**Convert your payslip PDF into transactions for YNAB, Mint, EveryDollar, or Monarch.**

`payslip2budget` is a command-line tool that extracts deductions and relevant information from payroll documents (like ADP payslips) and transforms them into budget transactions for your preferred financial tool.

## âœ¨ Features

- âœ… Extracts line items from ADP-style payslip PDFs  
- âœ… Groups deductions into customizable categories (e.g., HSA, insurance, retirement, taxes)  
- âœ… Outputs CSV files compatible with (disclaimer: only tested with YNAB!):
  - [YNAB (You Need A Budget)](https://www.ynab.com/)
  - [Mint](https://mint.intuit.com/)
  - [EveryDollar](https://www.everydollar.com/)
  - [Monarch](https://www.monarchmoney.com/)
- âœ… Adds an automatic offset deposit transaction to prevent double-counting taxes or deductions  
- âœ… Output to file, stdout (`-`), or send transactions directly to an API endpoint
- âœ… Extensible for new payslip formats, transaction data models, exporters, etc

### Arguments

| Argument         | Description                                            |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| `input.pdf`      | Path to the PDF payslip file                           |
| `output.csv`     | Output CSV file path (`-` for stdout). This argument is ignored if `--api-config` is used. |
| `--format`       | Output format: `ynab`, `mint`, `everydollar`, `monarch` (default: `ynab`) |
| `--api-config`   | Path to the API configuration JSON file (e.g., `api-config.json`). If provided, transactions are sent directly to the configured API, and `output.csv` and `--format` arguments are ignored. |

### Example

```bash
payslip2budget my_adp_payslip.pdf -
```

### Using the YNAB API Exporter

To send your transactions directly to YNAB instead of exporting to a CSV file, you'll use the `--api-config` command-line argument. This section guides you through setting up the necessary `api-config.json` file.

#### 1. Obtain Your YNAB Personal Access Token

To allow `payslip2budget` to send transactions to your YNAB account, you need to generate a Personal Access Token (API Key).

Here's how to get it:

1.  Log in to your YNAB account in a web browser.
2.  Go to the "My Account" section. You can usually find this by clicking your budget name in the top-left corner and then selecting "My Account" from the dropdown.
3.  Navigate to the "Developer Settings" tab.
4.  Click "New Token".
5.  Enter a descriptive name for the token (e.g., "payslip2budget_token") and click "Create".
6.  **Important:** YNAB will show you the token only once. Copy it immediately and store it in a safe place. You will need this for the `api-config.json` file.

For more detailed instructions, you can visit the official YNAB documentation: [Link to YNAB API Documentation - To be added]

#### 2. Find Your Budget ID

The `budget_id` tells `payslip2budget` which of your YNAB budgets to use.

1.  In your web browser, open the YNAB budget you want to use.
2.  Look at the URL in your browser's address bar. It will look something like this:
    `https://app.ynab.com/your_long_budget_id_string/budget/2024-07`
3.  The `your_long_budget_id_string` part is your Budget ID. Copy this string.
    *Example:* If your URL is `https://app.ynab.com/a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-1234-567890abcdef/budget/2024-07`, your `budget_id` is `a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-1234-567890abcdef`.

#### 3. Find Your Account ID

The `account_id` specifies which account within your selected budget will receive the transactions.

1.  In YNAB, navigate to the budget you'vechosen.
2.  Click on the specific account in the left sidebar that you want `payslip2budget` to send transactions to (e.g., "Checking Account").
3.  Look at the URL in your browser's address bar again. It will change to something like:
    `https://app.ynab.com/your_long_budget_id_string/accounts/your_long_account_id_string`
4.  The `your_long_account_id_string` part is your Account ID. Copy this string.
    *Example:* If your URL is `https://app.ynab.com/a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-1234-567890abcdef/accounts/z9y8x7w6-v5u4-3210-fedc-ba9876543210`, your `account_id` is `z9y8x7w6-v5u4-3210-fedc-ba9876543210`.

#### 4. Create Your `api-config.json` File

`payslip2budget` uses a configuration file named `api-config.json` to store your YNAB API credentials. You'll need to create this file in the same directory where you run the `payslip2budget` command, or you can provide a path to it using a command-line argument (support for this may vary).

1.  Create a new file named `api-config.json`.
2.  Copy the structure from the example file `payslip2budget/exporters/apihandlers/api-config.json.example`.
3.  Replace the placeholder values with your actual YNAB Personal Access Token, Budget ID, and Account ID that you collected in the previous steps.

Here's what the structure should look like:

```json
{
  "api": {
    "type": "ynab",
    "api_key": "YOUR_YNAB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN",
    "budget_id": "YOUR_BUDGET_ID",
    "account_id": "YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID"
  }
}
```

**Important Security Note:** Treat your `api-config.json` file like a password. Do **not** commit it to version control (e.g., Git) if you are working in a shared repository. The `.gitignore` file in this project should already be configured to ignore `api-config.json`, but it's good practice to be aware of this.

#### 5. Ensure Categories Exist in YNAB

The `payslip2budget` tool will attempt to match the categories found in your payslip (as defined in your `categories.json` mapping) to categories in your YNAB budget.

*   **Case Sensitivity:** This matching is case-sensitive. For example, "Medical" is different from "medical".
*   **Category Groups:** If you use category groups in YNAB (e.g., "Obligations:Rent"), ensure both the group and the category name match what `payslip2budget` will use. The YNAB API handler in this tool expects categories in the format `CategoryGroup:CategoryName` (e.g., `Insurance:Medical`). If a category isn't in a group, use just the category name (e.g., `Groceries`).
*   **Missing Categories:** If a category from your payslip data does not exist in YNAB under the specified budget, the API call will fail, and an error message will be displayed.

Before running the exporter, please verify that all categories you expect to be transferred are already set up in your YNAB budget with the exact same naming (including case and group structure if applicable).

#### 6. (Optional) Understanding Payee Handling

The YNAB API handler will attempt to match payee names from your payslip data to existing payees in your YNAB budget.

*   **Matching:** The matching is case-insensitive (e.g., "Employer Name" will match "employer name").
*   **New Payees:** If a payee name from the payslip does not exactly match an existing payee in YNAB, YNAB's API *may* create a new payee. However, for better control and to ensure consistency (e.g., avoiding slight variations like "Employer Inc." vs "Employer Inc"), you might prefer to pre-populate common payees in your YNAB account beforehand.
*   **No Payee ID in `api-config.json`:** Unlike `account_id` or `budget_id`, you do not need to specify individual `payee_id`s in the `api-config.json`. The script looks up payees by name.

Reviewing your YNAB payees after the first few imports can help you manage and merge any unintentionally created duplicates.

## ðŸ§ª Running Tests

```bash
pytest
```

## ðŸ§  Future Plans

- Let users supply custom formatters via plugins or JSON templates
- Support for non-ADP payslips
- Configurable category mapping

## TODOs
- update date to the check date if its not it
- match total deductions to the gross - net amount to confirm all lines are captured
- allow for batching pdfs in a directory to generate transactions for multiple payslips
